# USC Class Schedule Listing Scraper

This program is a little scraper for the [USC Class Schedule website](https://ssb.onecarolina.sc.edu/BANP/bwckschd.p_disp_dyn_sched).

It is written as a Python Notebook called [ParseSchedule.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/USCSoftware/parseclassschedule/blob/master/ParseSchedule.ipynb) (click that to view the code).

It uses:

* BeautifulSoup
* csvkit
* requests
